# DNI-logic-testing

This repository is aimed to practise
It's not included in any IT Academy Sprint, but the origin of this exercise was during the masterclass of TDD & Testing that took place in IT Academy the week of the 21th of December of 2022

This exercise needs to test with TDD methodology a function that given a number of 8 digits as a parameter, the function has to give back a letter. This letter has to follow the DNI (or NIF) logic
